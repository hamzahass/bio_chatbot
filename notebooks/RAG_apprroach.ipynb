During supraglottic, translaryngeal, and transtracheal HFJV, respectively, EEP was > or =10 mm Hg at diameters narrower than 5.5, 4.0, and 3.5 cm, and PIP was >20 mm Hg at diameters narrower than 5.5, 3.5, and 3.0 cm.

In a second experiment, the degree of ventilation and air entrainment was assessed by administering nitrous oxide 4 L/min to the model. Nitrous oxide concentrations were significantly (P < 0.01) smaller and nitrogen concentrations were significantly (P < 0.01) larger during supraglottic HFJV than either translaryngeal or transtracheal HFJV.

            "Abstract Background Cryptocoryne Schott ex Engelm., one of the most important aquatic plants in the world, has been widely used in ornamental ponds, water gardens, and fish culture systems due to its beautiful appearance and strong adaptability. However, little attention has been paid to the diversity of cryptocorynes in China so far. Methods Herein we describe a new species of Cryptocoryne collected from Guangxi Province, southern China, which can easily be distinguished from other congeneric taxa by having two types of leaves, i.e., submerged floating leaves and emergent foliage leaves. Results Phylogenetic analyses using combined plastid DNA sequences showed that our newly described species formed a clade sister to C. sinensis, but differed clearly from all known species of Cryptocoryne. Morphologically, the new species differs from related species mainly by possessing two types of leaves, i.e., submerged floating leaves and emergent foliage leaves, while only one type of leaf occurs in other members of the genus. Conclusions Based on these findings, we propose here a new species, Cryptocoryne guilinensis sp. nov.<EOD> Effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention to improve adherence to antiretrovirals among people living with HIV in Uganda: study protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial\n",
